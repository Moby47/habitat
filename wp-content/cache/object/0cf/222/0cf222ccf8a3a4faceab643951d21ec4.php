<h2>How it all began</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/02/At-WordCamp-Kampala-2020.jpeg?resize=632%2C844&#038;ssl=1" alt="Mary Job at WordCamp Kampala 2020" class="wp-image-8410" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/02/At-WordCamp-Kampala-2020.jpeg?resize=767%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 767w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/02/At-WordCamp-Kampala-2020.jpeg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/02/At-WordCamp-Kampala-2020.jpeg?resize=768%2C1025&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/02/At-WordCamp-Kampala-2020.jpeg?w=809&amp;ssl=1 809w" sizes="(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption>Mary Job at WordCamp Kampala 2020</figcaption></figure>



<p>Mary remembers when cybercaf√©s started trending in Nigeria. She had just finished high school and was awaiting her results for admission to university. She spent all of her time (10 hours a day) and all of her pocket money buying bulk time online at cafes. All the way through university that was true, until in 2008 she graduated with a degree in philosophy and bought her own computer and modem.</p>



<p>She started blogging in 2009. Initially, she tried out Blogger, Hubpages, and WordPress‚Äîbut found WordPress too complicated.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Growing up as a timid but curious cat</h2>



<p>Mary is one of four kids, and the only girl among her siblings. Throughout her childhood she felt shy, even though others didn‚Äôt always see her that way. </p>



<p>When she first started her personal blog, it was mostly an opportunity for her to speak her mind where she was comfortable. Blogging gave her a medium to express her thoughts and with every new post she became a better writer.</p>



<h2>Rediscovering WordPress</h2>



<p>After completing a postgraduate diploma in mass communication, Mary started a Masters degree in Information Management. This required a three month internship. She decided to volunteer in Ghana in 2015 at the headquarters of the Salesians of Don Bosco in West Africa (SDBAFW<strong>)</strong> where her uncle was based.</p>



<p>While she was there, her uncle asked Mary why she was not blogging on WordPress, which also happened to be the software the organisation used. She explained how difficult and complicated it was so he shared a group of beginner-level tutorial videos with her.</p>



<p>After two weeks of watching those videos, she started to realize she could have a full-time career doing this. So she immediately joined a number of online training groups so she could learn everything.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>I saw a lot of people earning an income from things I knew and did for the fun of it. I found myself asking why I had not turned my passion into a business.</em></p><cite>Mary Job</cite></blockquote>



<p>Not long after that, she was contacted by a website editor who was impressed by her blog. With the information available online for WordPress, she was able to learn everything she needed to improve and redesign a site for what turned into her first client.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/03/my-home-office-in-2016.jpeg?w=632&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-8412" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/03/my-home-office-in-2016.jpeg?w=512&amp;ssl=1 512w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/03/my-home-office-in-2016.jpeg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption>Mary&#8217;s home office in 2016</figcaption></figure>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>I visited the <a href="https://wordpress.org/showcase/">WordPress.org showcase</a> and was wowed with all the good things I could do with WordPress.</em></p><cite>Mary Job</cite></blockquote>



<p>In 2016 after a year of deep WordPress learning, she had fallen in love with the CMS and wanted to give back to the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/">WordPress open source project</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She volunteered to help the Community team. And when she moved to Lagos later that year, she discovered there was an active WordPress Meetup community. This started her journey toward becoming a WordPress Meetup Co-organizer and a Global Community Team Deputy.</p>



<p>Today the Nigerian WordPress community continues to grow, as has the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Lagos-WordPress-Meetup-Group">Lagos WordPress Meetup</a> group. The first Nigerian WordCamp took place in Lagos in 2018 and a <a href="https://2020.lagos.wordcamp.org/">2020 event is being planned</a>. A local WordPress community also developed in Mary‚Äôs hometown in Ijebu.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>I have made great friends and met co-organizers in the community who are dedicated to building and sharing their WordPress knowledge with the community like I am.</em></p><cite>Mary Job</cite></blockquote>



<h2>What did Mary gain from using and contributing to WordPress?</h2>



<ul><li>She <strong>overcame her stage fright</strong> by getting up in front of an audience at her local Meetup to introduce speakers and to talk about the WordPress community.&nbsp;</li><li>She <strong>attended her first of many African WordCamps </strong>in Cape Town, South Africa. Coincidentally this was also her first time outside West Africa. Before that, she had not been in an aircraft for more than one hour.</li><li>She <strong>earned money</strong> from WordPress web design projects to sustain her during her learning period. Mary continues to use WordPress in her work and says she is still learning every day!</li><li>She got to <strong>jump off</strong> Signal Hill in Cape Town when visiting a WordCamp!&nbsp;</li></ul>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>Essentially, the community has taught me to be a better communicator, and a better person. I‚Äôve made friends across the world that have become like a family to me.</em></p><cite>Mary Job</cite></blockquote>



<p>She now runs a village hub in Ijebu,&nbsp; where she teaches girls digital skills and WordPress as a way of giving back to her town.</p>



<p>Since she started on this journey, Mary has gotten a fulltime job supporting a WordPress plugin. She‚Äôs also become a Community Team Rep and continues to build and foster communities.</p>



<h2>Mary‚Äôs advice to others</h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>Always seek to understand the basics of whatever knowledge you seek. Never jump in too fast, wanting to spiral to the top while ignoring the learning curve. You will likely crash down effortlessly if you do so, and would have learned nothing.</em></p><cite>Mary Job</cite></blockquote>

<h2>WordCamp Asia 2020 Cancelled &amp; Pop-up Livestream</h2>



<p>There was a ton of excitement around WordCamp Asia, not to mention all the effort from organizers, speakers, sponsors and volunteers. Unfortunately, on February 12th, <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2020/02/wordcamp-asia-cancelled-due-to-covid-19/">WordCamp Asia was cancelled</a> due to concern and uncertainty around COVID-19. Since then, the organizing team has worked to <a href="https://2020.asia.wordcamp.org/2020/02/12/cancellation/">refund tickets and to support hotel and air refunds</a>. In addition, a <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2020/02/pop-up-livestream-on-february-22/">pop-up livestream</a> featuring some WordCamp Asia speakers and a Fireside Chat and Q&amp;A with Matt Mullenweg took place on February 22nd.</p>



<p>For a personal take on the cancellation of WordCamp Asia, read <a href="https://naoko.blog/2020/02/13/wordcamp-asia-2020-recap/">this post from Naoko Takano</a>, the global lead organizer. Many thanks to the volunteers who worked hard to deliver WordCamp Asia. They‚Äôve not only handled logistics associated with cancellation but have also announced that they‚Äôve started <a href="https://2020.asia.wordcamp.org/2020/02/18/wordcamp-asia-2021/">working on WordCamp Asia 2021</a> with some January dates in mind!

<h2>WordPress 5.4 Beta is Now Available</h2>



<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2020/02/wordpress-5-4-beta-1/">WordPress 5.4 Beta 1</a> was released on February 11 and quickly followed by <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2020/02/wordpress-5-4-beta-2/">Beta 2</a> on February 18 and <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2020/02/wordpress-5-4-beta-3/">Beta 3</a> on February 25. These two releases get us closer to our primary goal for 2020: full-site editing with blocks. WordPress 5.4 will merge ten releases of the Gutenberg plugin and is scheduled to be released on March 31, 2020. It will come with many new features, such as two new blocks for social links and buttons, and easier navigation in the block breadcrumbs. There are also a number of accessibility improvements, such as easier multi-block selection and easier tabbing, one of the editor‚Äôs biggest accessibility issues. <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/5-4/">5.4 will also include</a> many developer-focused changes, such as improved favicon handling and many new hooks and filters.</p>

<p>This should be a great way to get to hear from some speakers who have yet to share their knowledge on a global stage. WordPress is enriched by a multitude of experiences and perspectives, and I hope you are as excited as I am to hear new voices from a part of the world that is frequently underrepresented in the WordPress open source project.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also exciting, <a href="https://2020.asia.wordcamp.org/2020/02/18/wordcamp-asia-2021/">the WordCamp Asia team has announced that they‚Äôre aiming for January 2021</a>, so please mark your calendars now! This small but mighty team of trailblazing organizers has shown great resilience over the years they‚Äôve spent, building toward this event. I am personally grateful for the hard work they‚Äôve done and have yet to do, and can‚Äôt wait to thank them in Bangkok next year.</p>

<h2><strong>The beginning</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/02/kori-ashton.jpg?w=632&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-8349" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/02/kori-ashton.jpg?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/02/kori-ashton.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/02/kori-ashton.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/02/kori-ashton.jpg?resize=768%2C767&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption>Kori Ashton</figcaption></figure>



<p>In 1998, Kori created her very first HTML website. Her dad was creating websites for a living at the time. She needed a website for her band because she wanted to be a rockstar. Under his training, and with a little bit of self-teaching, she learned how to build a website.</p>



<p>She had been aware of WordPress since 2005, and, in 2008 a client specifically hired her as a freelancer to develop a WordPress website. Kori went straight to Google and taught herself how to build a WordPress website over a single weekend. She really enjoyed the experience of working with WordPress.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>My mind was absolutely blown when I saw the drag and drop options inside of menus to create dropdowns and a form builder.&nbsp;</em></p><cite>Kori Ashton</cite></blockquote>



<p>She suggested to her dad that WordPress could be a solution for their customers who wanted to be able to access their own websites. Previously, they had found this was not as easy for clients unless they had specific software and knew how to code. So, Kori and her dad worked to learn WordPress over the next few years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then in 2012, Kori and her parents launched their new business, WebTegrity, in San Antonio, Texas, US. It started out small: just Kori and her parents. Soon, they started subcontracting design work and quickly continued to grow their team.</p>



<h2><strong>Going big time</strong></h2>



<p>Even though the business was in a saturated industry in San Antonio &#8212; over 700 freelancers and agencies were providing similar services &#8212;  Kori and her parents were able to sell their company five years later, with a multi-million dollar valuation. There were a few choices they made early on that led to that success.</p>



<h3><strong>1. They picked a niche: WordPress specialists&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>At the time, there were no WordPress-specific agencies in San Antonio. They emphasized the fact that WordPress was the only CMS their company would use. Prospective clients looking for a different type of CMS solution were not the right fit for their business. They also offered on-site, WordPress training and weekend workshops that were open to anyone (including other agencies) as one of their revenue streams. They soon were established as a city-wide WordPress authority.</p>



<h3><strong>2. They cultivated a culture</strong></h3>



<p>Kori wanted a great culture and environment in her company and to make that happen, she needed to hire the right people. She believes you must be careful about who you bring into the culture of your business, but particularly when hiring leaders into that community. You can‚Äôt teach passion so you‚Äôve got to find people that are excited about what you do. You also need to look for integrity, creativity, a love for solving problems, and an eagerness to keep getting better.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>You can teach code all day long, but be sure to find people with the right hearts to join your community and then train them up the right way. This way you will grow your culture in a healthy way.</em></p><cite>Kori Ashton</cite></blockquote>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/02/kori-ashton-2.png?w=632&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-8350" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/02/kori-ashton-2.png?w=711&amp;ssl=1 711w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/02/kori-ashton-2.png?resize=287%2C300&amp;ssl=1 287w" sizes="(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption>Kori and her two sons</figcaption></figure>



<h3><strong>3. They learned how to build sustainable revenue streams</strong></h3>



<p>Like many other web development agencies, WebTegrity started out with the ‚Äúone-time fee and you‚Äôre done‚Äù business model. This business model is known for unpredictable revenue streams. Hearing about recurring revenue business models at WordCamp Austin was a lightbulb moment for Kori. She started drafting a more sustainable business model on the way back home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Support packages were key to their new business plan. Clients needed ongoing support. They decided to include at least 12 months of post-launch support into their web development projects. This doubled their revenue in one year and allowed them to even out their revenue streams.</p>



<h3><strong>4. They knew the importance of reputation</strong></h3>



<p>Kori believes that every client, whether they have a $5,000 or a $50,000 budget, should get the same type of boutique-style, white glove, concierge relationship.</p>



<p>Every single project results in the absolute best solution for a client&#8217;s needs. In addition to that, offering training helped boost their reputation. Explaining the lingo of the web development and SEO fields and showing the processes used, added transparency. It helped set and meet expectations and it built trust.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>5. They proactively gave back to the community</strong></h3>



<p>Kori heard Matt Mullenweg speak about <a href="https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/">Five For The Future</a> at WordCamp US. He encouraged people in the audience who make a living using WordPress, to find ways to give back 5% of their time to building the WordPress software and community. Matt talked about how firms and individuals could give back to the community. He suggested, for instance to:</p>



<ul><li>start a WordPress Meetup group</li><li>present at a Meetup event&nbsp;</li><li>facilitate a Meetup group where maybe you‚Äôre just the organizer and you never have to speak because you‚Äôre not a fan of speaking</li><li>help organize a WordCamp</li><li>volunteer at a WordCamp</li><li>write a tutorial and tell people how to do WordPress related things&nbsp;</li><li>run a workshop</li><li>make a video</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/02/kori-ashton-3.jpg?fit=632%2C422&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-8351" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/02/kori-ashton-3.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/02/kori-ashton-3.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/02/kori-ashton-3.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/02/kori-ashton-3.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/02/kori-ashton-3.jpg?w=1264&amp;ssl=1 1264w" sizes="(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px" /><figcaption>If you&#8217;re making an income using WordPress, consider giving 5% of your time back to building the software and/or the community.</figcaption></figure>



<p>This gave Kori another light bulb moment. She could make videos to give back. So her way to give back to the WordPress community is her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/webtegrity">YouTube channel</a>.</p>



<p>Every Wednesday, she published a video on how to improve your online marketing. This made a huge impact, both inside the WordPress community, but also in her own business.</p>



<h2><strong>Understanding</strong></h2>



<p>So, in summary, how did Kori and her family turn their business into a multi-million dollar buyout in just five years?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ultimately, it was about understanding that you have to build value. About keeping an exit strategy in mind while building your business. For instance when naming your company. Will it stand alone? Could it turn into a brand that you could sell as an independent entity?</p>



<ul><li>Think about revenue streams and watch sales margins.</li><li>Be sure to include healthy margins.&nbsp;</li><li>Don‚Äôt hire until you have no further option.</li><li>Make sure to structure your offerings in such a way that you‚Äôre actually recouping your value.&nbsp;</li><li>Understand entrepreneurship, watch Shark Tank, read more tutorials, watch more videos.</li><li>Get involved in the WordPress community. Get to know its core leaders, the speakers that travel around to all the WordCamps. Start following them on Twitter and try to understand what they‚Äôre sharing.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>In the end, the fact that Kori was so active in the San Antonio community helped enable the sale.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>We just kept hammering on the fact that we were the go-to place here in San Antonio for WordPress. We kept training, we kept doing free opportunities, going out and speaking at different events, and people kept seeing us. We kept showing up, kept giving back and kept establishing ourselves as the authority.</em></p><cite>Kori Ashton</cite></blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;ve arrived at the difficult decision to cancel the inaugural WordCamp Asia event, which was planned to take place in Bangkok on February 21st. The excitement and anticipation around this event have been huge, but there are too many unknowns around the health issues unfolding right now in the region to explicitly encourage a large public gathering bringing together over 1,300 people from around the world.</p>



<p>We‚Äôre going to explore if speakers ‚Äî including myself ‚Äî can do our sessions with the same content and at the same time that was originally planned, just online instead of in-person so we can achieve our goal of bringing the pan-Asian community closer together without putting anyone&#8217;s health at additional risk.</p>



<p>Regardless, I greatly appreciate the work everyone ‚Äî from organizers to attendees,&nbsp; speakers to sponsors ‚Äî put into making this a big success. So many people have come together to create an event to inspire and connect WordPressers, and I am confident that this passion will carry through into the event next year. Our thoughts are with everyone affected by the virus so far, and we sincerely hope that everything is resolved quickly so that this precaution looks unnecessary in hindsight.</p>

<p>WordPress 5.4 is slated for release on&nbsp;<a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-4/">March 31, 2020</a>, and <strong>we need your help to get there</strong>!</p>



<p>While the <strong>primary goal for 2020 is full-site editing with blocks</strong>, contributors to WordPress are working across every area of the project to ensure the software continues moving forward.</p>



<p>Testing for bugs is an important part of polishing the release during the beta stage and a great way to contribute. Here are some of the big changes and features to pay close attention to while testing.</p>



<h2>Block Editor: features and improvements</h2>



<p>WordPress 5.4 Core will merge ten releases of the Gutenberg plugin. This means there‚Äôs a long list of exciting new features. Here are just a few:</p>



<ul><li>Two new blocks: social links and buttons.</li><li>More color options for Button, Cover, Group and Column blocks .</li><li>A <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/18041">Welcome Guide modal</a>.</li><li>Tools for adding featured images in the Latest Posts block.</li><li>Easier navigation in the block breadcrumbs.</li></ul>



<p>Some additional changes to make note of:</p>



<ul><li>On mobile, the toolbar stays on top, so you can&#8217;t lose it.</li><li>Easier image sizing in the Gallery block.</li><li>Drag-and-drop images into the featured-image box.</li><li>Several new APIs.</li><li>Friendlier offline error messages on REST API request failures.</li><li>Table block captions.</li><li>You can now color just parts of the text in any RichText block. </li></ul>



<h3>Accessibility improvements</h3>



<ul><li>Easier multi-block selection.&nbsp;</li><li>Support for changing an image&#8217;s title attribute within the Image block.</li><li>Easier tabbing. This had been one of the editor&#8217;s biggest accessibility problems, but now tabbing works with the block‚Äôs sidebar.</li><li>Visual switch between Edit and Navigation modes and enable screen reader announcements.</li></ul>

<h3>Continuing efforts to improve performance</h3>



<p>The block editor team has achieved a 14% loading time reduction and 51% time-to-type reduction, for a particularly sizable post (~ 36,000 words, ~1,000 blocks) since WordPress 5.3.</p>



<h2>Wait! There&#8217;s more</h2>



<h3>Site Health </h3>



<p>When a project powers 34% of the world&#8217;s websites, there must be a focus on security. This is why contributors continue working so hard on the Site Health Project.</p>



<p>WordPress 5.4 adds a widget on the dashboard that warns administrators of potential issues that could affect their site&#8217;s performance or security. A call-to-action button directs them to the Site Health screen for details and suggested fixes.</p>



<h3>Accessibility improvements</h3>



<p>WordPress strives to improve accessibility with every release, and this release is no different. Version 5.4 will contain the following accessibility enhancements:</p>



<ul><li>Better focus management in Menu, Customizer and Site Health screens, to fix some existing keyboard navigation issues.</li><li>Easier keyboard navigation for better semantics in the Media modal.</li><li>An easier-to-read Privacy Policy Guide.</li></ul>



<h2>For Developers</h2>



<p>5.4 also contains a bunch of developer focused changes.</p>



<h3>Calendar Widget </h3>



<p>The HTML 5.1 specification mandates that a <code>&lt;tfoot&gt;</code> tag must follow&nbsp;<code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code> tag (which was not the case in the calendar widget). WordPress 5.4 moves the navigation links to a <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> HTML element immediately following the <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> element in order to produce valid HTML.</p>



<h3>apply_shortcodes() as an alias for do_shortcode()</h3>



<p>Instead of using <code>do_shortcode()</code>, <code>apply_shortcodes()</code> should be utilized instead. While <code>do_shortcode()</code> is not being deprecated, the new function delivers better semantics.</p>



<h3>Better favicon handling</h3>



<p>Now favicon requests can be managed with more flexibility. Administrators can choose a favicon in the Customizer, or upload a <code>/favicon.ico</code> file. The WordPress logo will always load as a fallback.</p>



<h3>Other changes for developers</h3>



<ul><li>Clearer information about errors in <code>wp_login_failed</code>.</li><li>Site ID has been added to the <code>newblog_notify_siteadmin</code> filter for multisite installs.</li><li>Support has been added for the required WordPress and PHP version headers in themes.</li><li>Embed support has been added for TikTok.</li></ul>



<p>Keep your eyes on the&nbsp;<a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/">Make WordPress Core blog</a>&nbsp;for &nbsp;<a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/5-4+dev-notes/">5.4-related developer notes</a>&nbsp;in the coming weeks, breaking down these and other changes in greater detail.</p>



<p>So far, contributors have fixed more than <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;milestone=5.4&amp;group=component&amp;max=500&amp;col=id&amp;col=summary&amp;col=owner&amp;col=type&amp;col=priority&amp;col=component&amp;col=version&amp;order=priority">255 tickets in WordPress 5.4</a> with more to come.</p>
